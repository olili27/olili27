- 👋 Hi, I’m Timothy Olili
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, unlearning and relearning technologies that assemble me for backend development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are in line with my tech-stack or can introduce me to new challenges of similar-related technologies in the realm of web development.
