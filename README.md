- 👋 Hi, I’m @olili27
- 👀 I’m interested in learning, unlearning and relearning technologies that assemble me for fullstack web development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the technologies for front-end development, in particular, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Figma.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that are in line with my tech-stack or can introduce me to new challenges of similar-related technologies in the realm of web development.
